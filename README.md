# Deep Learning tutorial 

&copy; Credits: This repo is a modified version of the original content kindly proposed by [Rishit Dagli](https://www.rishit.tech/) on [Github](https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/Deep-Learning-With-TensorFlow) and in a blog series on [Medium](http://bit.ly/dlwithtf).

This repo gets you started with Deep Learning with TensorFlow. This will be all about about coding Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. I believe in hands-on coding 
so we will have many exercises and demos which you can try yourself too. You would first have a blog to read to and have one or many Jupyter Notebooks which you can try and also 
have excercises which you can do.

## Do you need any setup?

No! You would not need any hardware or software setup to work your way around these tutorials, each of the notebooks have a button ![Open in Colab button](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) which you can use to open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (We'll often refer to this as just Colab) right in your browser :rocket: . If you do not know about Google Colab head on to the [first part](https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/Deep-Learning-With-TensorFlow/tree/master/Part%201-Getting%20started%20with%20TensorFlow%20and%20Deep%20Learning) which also gives an intro about Colab. If you are more comfortable with using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) you can use this button [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Rishit-dagli/Deep-Learning-With-TensorFlow/master) to open this repo in Binder.

## Why should you be learning this?

To keep the tutorials concise and to-the-point I have not included this in the tutorials itself.
If you are a newbie to Machine Learning you would most likely wonder why would you be interested in any of this? However, if you have worked with same other ML Framework or library and want to know about TensorFlow you can simply skip this section.

Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized the way people think, learn, and work in almost every field. You most probably make more use of this than you would imagine. Think about games, the famous YouTube recommendation algorithm or Google Photos identifying faces or identifying if an image is a person or an animal (You will be making a similar program in [Part-5](https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/Deep-Learning-With-TensorFlow/tree/master/Part%205-Working%20with%20Complex%20Image%20data%20for%C2%A0CNNs) ) all powered by Machine Learning. In these tutorials you will be exploring more of the practical aspect of this :smiley: .
